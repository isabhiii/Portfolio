# Portfolio
**I have made this Portfolio with the SQL and Tableau.**

In 2020, when Covid pendemic hits, We saw many people suffering from it. We eventually found the vaccines and treat the people. Many lives were saved, but unfortunately we also lost many. Although, people have started living normal lives, there are still many people still suffering from this. There are still many countries out there in the world, fighting this virus. 

I wanted to see and help you see, with the power of programming, the impact it has made on the lives of people, and the countries.
I learned SQL and Tableau, with these, I have created a Dashboard. I can see the Deathrate, Lives that were saved with vaccines, and many other important aspect of it with just few clicks. It is easy and very user friendly. I will update it, if I ever feel necessary, ot may be will make another from the scratch.

*Note: I have also put some notes for the people who are trying to understand it. So, everyone can understand it and learn from it.*

I have successfully collected and processed millions of rows of data through the use of Excel and MySQL technologies. This involved extensive data cleaning, which I accomplished through the implementation of various SQL techniques, including:

* Joining tables
* Using common table expressions (CTEs)
* Creating temporary tables
* Utilizing window functions and aggregate functions
* Generating views
* Converting data types

My proficiency in SQL allowed me to effectively craft queries for data cleaning and analysis. The resulting data was then imported into Tableau, where I created interactive dashboards to effectively communicate insights through visualization.

🧑🏻‍💻 Happy Coding 🧑🏻‍💻
